# booksForBeABetterProgrammer

I want to make clear about the knowledge and books that you will find here.

1. The books that you'll find here don't belong to me, either I didn't write them.
2. I just publish this knowledge with educational purposes.
3. I consider that this knowledge contained here is still relevant to anyone that wants to be a software engineer.
